# PizZa ShOp

This project is to build a pizza shop website where a customer can order his/her own pizza according to his preference by choosing the size of the pizza, crust and topping and the website will calculate the total amount

You own a pizza place and as a way of trying to widen your customer base, you decide to create a web application where your customers order different sizes of pizzas with one or more toppings.
